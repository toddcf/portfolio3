# To Do:

## Global:

- Style all text links. The homepage currently does not have footer underlines on hover, but About Me does. (And it shouldn't.)


## About Me:

- Unlink `homepage.css`. Change anything in common to `global.css`.

- Bio
- Professional References
- Skills
- Certificates
  - Hardcode a text-box height for each breakpoint.
  - Parallax bg image.
  - Style each card.


## Walkthrough Pages

### Acura of Tempe Walkthrough:

- The value of the white-background rising image.
- How one of the images disappears on small screens.
- The slider button hover effect.


### BMW of El Cajon Walkthrough:

- Show the button hover effect WITH and WITHOUT my solution so the user can see the flash.
- Show the difference WITH and WITHOUT my linear gradient behind the H1.


### My Portfolio Walkthrough:

- How I solved the white-gradient background issue.
  - Two separate divs, one going from 0 to 50% opacity, the second going from 50% to 100% opacity.
- How the portfolio cards have a different layout and style for every screen size.
- How I structured and styled the mobile cards: Secondary buttons have an inverse hover effect compared to medium and large screens; Created blurry (12px) bg image in Photoshop just for mobile; Negative margin-top for the smaller image at the top; Box shadow for depth.
- How the linear-gradient button hover effects work.
- How the fadeInUp animations work, and how they have different delays depending on the screen size.


## When Finished:

- Run Google page speed insights test.
- Add Google Analytics throughout entire site.
- At the very end, delete all unused font customizations.
- Deployment checklist on every single file.
