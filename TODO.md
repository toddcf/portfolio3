# To Do:

- Fonts
  - Choose fonts.
  - Responsive sizing for each breakpoint.
- Style all buttons.
  - Get JS and jQuery hooked up and test the wave effect.
  - Once it's working, keep only the needed code.
  - Fix the gap between the "Live" and "GitHub" buttons when side by side.
  - Add GitHub and Live icons to buttons.
  - Responsive sizing.
- Style H2, H3, H4.
- At the very end, delete all unused font customizations.
- Maybe consolidate the fonts.css file into the global.css file once all editing is done.
