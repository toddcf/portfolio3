# To Do:

- Fonts
  - Choose fonts.
  - Style H2, H3, H4.
  - Responsive sizing AND SPACING for each breakpoint.
- BMW of El Cajon Walkthrough:
  - Show the button hover effect WITH and WITHOUT my solution so the user can see the flash.
- Portfolio Walkthrough:
  - How the portfolio cards have a different layout and style for every screen size.
  - How I structured and styled the mobile cards: Secondary buttons have an inverse hover effect compared to medium and large screens; Created blurry (12px) bg image in Photoshop just for mobile; Negative margin-top for the smaller image at the top; Box shadow for depth.
  - How the linear-gradient button hover effects work.
- At the very end, delete all unused font customizations.
- Maybe consolidate the fonts.css file into the global.css file once all editing is done.
