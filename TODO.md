# To Do:

## Walkthrough Pages

### My Portfolio Walkthrough:

- Remove the "Live Site" header icon from the Portfolio Walkthrough.

### All Walkthroughs

Header IMG sizes (39%):
- xs only: 576 x 227
- sm only: 768 x 302
- md only: 992 x 390
- lg up: 1268 x 499


### Acura of Tempe Walkthrough:

- Lg and up: Make header icons green instead of gray, for readability.
- The value of the white-background rising image.
- How one of the images disappears on small screens.
- The slider button hover effect.
- NSX gradients that make section breaks blend together.


### BMW of El Cajon Walkthrough:

- Show the button hover effect WITH and WITHOUT my solution so the user can see the flash. (Unless just using `background-image` for both would have allowed the transition to work?)
- H1: Show the difference WITH and WITHOUT my linear gradient behind it.

### Honda of New Rochelle:

- Original: http://rsp-hondaofnewrochelle.fzautomotive.com/2018-honda-accord
- Mockups (JPGs for mobile and desktop).
- Video background with fallback image.
- Animations and Waypoints.


## When Finished:

- Delete all unused font customizations.
- Delete all unused Bootstrap files (including JS files).
- Run Google page speed insights test.
- Add Google Analytics throughout entire site.
- Deployment checklist on every single file.
